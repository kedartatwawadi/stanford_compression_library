# Stanford Compression Library
The goal of the library is to help with research in the area of data compression. This is not meant to be fast or efficient implementation, but rather for educational purpose

## Getting started
- Create conda environment and install required packages:
    ```
    conda create --name myenv python=3.8.2
    conda activate myenv
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Add path to the repo to `PYTHONPATH`:
    ```
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
    ``` 

- Run unit tests: <br>

    To run all tests
    ```
    find . -name "*_tests.py" -exec py.test -s -v {} +
    ```
    
    To run a single test
    ```
    py.test -s -v core/data_block_tests.py
    ```

## Getting started with understanding the library
In-depth information about the library will be in the comments. Tutorials/articles etc will be posted on the wiki page:

## How to submit code

Run a formatter before submitting PR
```
black <dir/file> --line-length 100
```

Note that the Github actions CI uses flake8 as a lint (see [`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`](.github/workflows/python-app.yml)), which is compatible with the `black` formatter as discussed [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html#flake8).
